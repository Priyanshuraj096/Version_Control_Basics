# Version_Control_Basics
I will be sharing about version control. Helpful for those who are beginners and planning to develop their first project.



# What is the role of Version Control ?
1. Keep Track of Changes
2. It is just file DataBase
3. Most common VCS are GitHub(Free) and BitBucket(Paid)
4. Allow multiple commit at same time
5. Everyone can have their own branch

# What steps involved while collaborating on any project

PULL ->  ADD -> COMMIT -> PUSH -> REVIEW(BY ADMIN) -> MERGE

# What is Regression Testing ?

- Regression testing ensures any new feature or code base change does not adversely affect the pre-exisiting features.
- It's full or partial selection of already executed test cases which are re-executed to ensure existing functionalities work fine.
